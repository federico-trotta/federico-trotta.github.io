## Achievements
Before presenting my articles, I'd like my achievements talk for me. I believe this is a good way for you to understand the quality of my work and the results we can get together:
- **Selected by NVIDIA**: Given my expertise and the articles I created in the field of Articifial Intelligence, I've been selected by NVIDIA for a pre-briefing where they presented the Polars GPU engine in preview:

    *The invitation to the pre-briefing*
    ```

    And here's the article I wrote for them: [Accelerating Polars with RAPIDS cuDF](https://dev.to/federicotrotta/accelerating-polars-with-rapids-cudf-3833)

- **Spotted by DZONE**: One of my articles on Data Engineering has been featured on the DZone main page on the 14th of June 2024 as a spotlighted article (see it [here](#my-articles-for-dzone))

- **Recognized as one of the most read TDS's contributors**: I was recognized as one of the most read authors by Towards Data Science:
