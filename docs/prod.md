# Products documentation
This section shows how I document digital products.

## Documentation for Dectar
As the only Technical Writer in the firm, I had the honor and the responsibility to define the structure of the documentation, both in English and Italian.\
\
I also provided comprehensive internal documentation to ensure all teams are up-to-date with [Dectar](https://dectar.com/) solutions.\
Especially, I helped the Support Team keep track of the troubleshooting by writing internal procedures.\
​​\
When I started this collaboration, there was some documentation but this was a task performed only by the Support Team. I rearranged and polished the existing content to help users better understand the products, and started creating new documentation.\
\
Read how I did all of these in the dedicated [case study](https://federicotrotta.com/case-studies/).
\
Dectar develops two digital products:
- ACSIA: a cyber security solution that helps you prevent cyber attacks.
- ACSIA CRA: a cyber security solution that evaluates your infrastructure's exposure to the internet.

:::{note}
My job with Dectar was to provide standardization and best practices, while revamping the pre-existing documentation and creating the new one. After about a year of collaboration,
the team had all the instruments to create the documentation on their own as the most important milestones where accomplished through my work.

## Documentation for Tabular Tools
### Documentation for Dax Optimizer
I've contributed in creating the documentation for DAX Optimizer: a software that performs a static analysis of DAX measures in a Power BI or Analysis Services model to improve teir performance.

As I started the collaboration, the company already created some documentation in a docs-as-code environment.

I revamped the pre-existing documentation, by implementing best practices and standards, and created new documentation for missing parts.

Read the documentation of Dax Optimizer [here](https://docs.daxoptimizer.com/).


### Documentation for OKVIZ
I'm contributing to the documentation of Calendar Pro: an integration for Power BI that enhanches the visualization for dates.

Read the documentation for Calendar Pro [here](https://docs.okviz.com/calendar-pro/).

## Documentation for Temera
[Temera](https://temera.it/) is an Italian company, leader in IoT solutions for the Fashion/Luxury & Retail sector.

I'm contributing to the creation of the documentation for their digital products. In particular:
- I've created the user manual for [Stylewhere](https://temera.it/it/soluzioni/stylewhere.html).
- I'm currently working on the user manual for [T.journey](https://temera.it/it/soluzioni/tjourney.html)

:::{note}
As these are user manuals for users who buy the products, the documentation is not publicly available.

## Documentation for Project Elevate
Documenting a product is not only related to helping users get their tasks done with a particular software through documentation. It can also be to show stakeholders how a particular software works to reach a particular goal.\
\
I had the pleasure of working with [Project Elevate](https://www.projectelevate.io/) on a project regarding documentation to be presented to "Big Data London" at a seminar.
The seminar was titled "[REAL TIME AND HISTORICAL NLP-ENRICHED MARKET DASHBOARD WITH RISINGWAVE AND CHAT-GPT](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/real-time-and-historical-nlp-enriched-market-dashboard-with-risingwave-and-chat-gpt-2/)":

The seminar attendee - Karin Wolok, CEO of Project Elevate - presented the documentation I created. This is about how to use Rising Wave for efficient stream processes in real-time data together with ChatGPT, to enrich the real-time data stream, with the objective to predict the stock market.
Here's the front page of the documentation I created for the seminar:
