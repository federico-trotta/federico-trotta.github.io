# Products documentation
This section shows how I document digital products.

## Documentation for Dectar
As the only Technical Writer in the firm, I had the honor and the responsibility to define the structure of the documentation, both in English and Italian.\
\
I also provide comprehensive internal documentation to ensure all teams are up-to-date with [Dectar](https://dectar.com/) solutions.\
Especially, I help the Support Team keep track of the troubleshooting by writing internal procedures.\
​​\
When I started this collaboration, there was some documentation but this was a task performed by the Support Team. I rearranged and polished the existing content to help users better understand the products, and started creating new documentation.\
\
Read how I did all of these in the dedicated [case study](https://federicotrotta.com/case-studies/).
\
4Securitas develops two digital products:
- ACSIA: a cyber security solution that helps you prevent cyber attacks.
- ACSIA CRA: a cyber security solution that evaluates your infrastructure's exposure to the internet.

Read the documentation I created here:
- [ACSIA CRA](https://support.dectar.com/hc/en-us/sections/12807213245085-ACSIA-CRA)
- [ACSIA (old version)](https://support.dectar.com/hc/en-us/sections/12807172890269-ACSIA-V6-4-x-or-lower)
- [ACSIA (new version)](https://support.dectar.com/hc/en-us/sections/14289643278749-ACSIA-V6-5-x)

:::{warning}
ACSIA is currently being revamped, this is why the documentation of the new version is not comprehensive (but it will be soon)

## Documentation for Project Elevate
Documenting a product is not only related to helping users get their tasks done with a particular software through documentation. It can also be to show stakeholders how a particular software works to reach a particular goal.\
\
I had the pleasure of working with [Project Elevate](https://www.projectelevate.io/) on a project regarding documentation to be presented to "Big Data London" at a seminar.
The seminar was titled "[REAL TIME AND HISTORICAL NLP-ENRICHED MARKET DASHBOARD WITH RISINGWAVE AND CHAT-GPT](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/real-time-and-historical-nlp-enriched-market-dashboard-with-risingwave-and-chat-gpt-2/)":

The seminar attendee - Karin Wolok, CEO of Project Elevate - presented the documentation I created. This is about how to use Rising Wave for efficient stream processes in real-time data together with ChatGPT, to enrich the real-time data stream, with the objective to predict the stock market.
Here's the front page of the documentation I created for the seminar:
