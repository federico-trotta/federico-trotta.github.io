# Publications
I contributed to the following publications:
- [Image-based Defect Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9460291): I contributed to develop a project that detects missing screw in assembly lines with Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
- [Operators-based Anomaly Detection In Lean Manufacturing Assembly Lines](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374470763_Operators-based_Anomaly_Detection_In_Lean_Manufacturing_Assembly_Lines): My Bachelors’ thesis “production data analysis with Data Science techniques” resulted in deep a research.
